### Multilingual Scolding 
  
At some point in 2018, I started collecting the words and phrases that parents / caregivers use to scold or threaten their children, in different languages. The list is very interesting, and somewhat scary, perhaps. Turns out that there is a whole range of creative and ingenious phrases that parents use to make their children behave. Some are somewhat mild and kind of sweet, like *Umemea pembe wee* in Swahili, which roughly translates to "you have grown horns", or *Halt die Schnauze* in German, which means "hold your snout!" (admittedly, the label of 'kind of sweet' comes from someone who came to hear of these phrases for research, and not from someone who heard these words as a child when they were in trouble; I'd imagine the latter scenario would be scarier). Others are less nice, such as *Иттiн баласы* in Kazakh, which translates to "child of a dog!" 

Here are some of my other favorites: 
- 生舊叉燒好過生你 ("I'd rather have given birth to a piece of BBQ pork than you", Cantonese)
- Мало не покажется! ("It won't seem like a little thing..." (like when a child does something they thought wasn't a big deal, Russian)
- En la casa vas a ver ("You'll see when we get back home" (a classic across different languages), Spanish)
- Va pleurer, tu pisseras moins ("Go ahead and cry, you'll piss less", French)
- S’e ngon nanën e ngon njerkën! ("If you dont listen to your mother, you end up listening to your stepmother!", Albanian) <br/>

And this is one I personally grew up with, which is also what inspired me to undertake this project: 
- मुझसे बुरा कोई नहीं होगा... ("No one will be worse than me..." (used in threats, for instance "If you don't clean up your room, no one will be worse than me"), Hindi) 

Till now, I have collected 72 words and phrases, in 32 different languages or dialects. If you remember any interesting or creative words and phrases that were used to scold you, or that you use to scold those around you, please fill in [this]() google form so I can add them to my list!
