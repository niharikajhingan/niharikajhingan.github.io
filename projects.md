Here are some of the projects I have worked on, or am currently working on:

### Computational Models of Implicatures <sub>*May 2020 - Present* <sub /> 
  
I am currently working on this project with Ellie Pavlick and Roman Feiman, to 

*Linguistics, Discourse NLP*

### Grammatical Gender Assignment in Code-Switching <sub>*August 2020 - Present*<sub/> 
  
Working with Masako Fidler, Russian, Czech and English 

*Linguistics*

### Comparative Analysis of Neural and Symbolic Models for Grammatical Acceptability <sub>*March 2020 - May 2020* <sub/> 
  
I worked with a group on a competitive analysis of the ability of symbolic models (a symbolic parser) and neural models (an LSTM) to detect grammatical acceptability. 
We implemented a simple symbolic parser and an LSTM model trained on the Penn Treebank. 
We then compared their accuracy in detecting grammatical acceptability using the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset.

### Hate speech detection <sub>*November 2019 - December 2020*<sub/> 
  
I collaborated on a group project to make a hate speech detector. We built an LSTM model trained on a dataset of comments from an online hate community forum to detect instances of hate speech (Pytorch).

### SleepCoacher <sub>*January 2019 - May 2020*<sub/> 
  
I worked on SleepCoacher, a mobile app that enables users to choose experiments, tracks user sleep data daily, and makes recommendations based on the data collected. The SleepCoacher mobile application can be found on the App Store.
Worked on the design and development of the iOS  app. I used Swift and Firebase for the app implementation. 
Helped launch the first non-beta version of the iOS application, along with multiple subsequent updated versions.
Collaborated on a study with veterans to investigate how they can use the application to improve sleep habits.
Conducted user interviews with veterans using the application to find helpful features and areas for improvements, and worked on thematic analysis of interview transcripts and diary logs, and data analysis of metric data.
