### Computational Models of Implicatures 
<sub>*May 2020 - Present* <sub /> 
  
I am working on this project advised by professors Ellie Pavlick and Roman Feiman. We are exploring pragmatic reasoning and implicatures, and the generation of alternatives in computing an implicature. We are focusing on: 
- How these alternatives are structured and used, cognitively
- How these alternatives can be computationally modelled and generated 

I have co-presented at the Brown Unconference, and submitted a poster to the Brown Summer Research Symposium.

### Comparative Analysis of Neural and Symbolic Models for Grammatical Acceptability 
<sub>*March 2020 - May 2020* <sub/> 
  
I worked with a group on a competitive analysis of the ability of symbolic models (a symbolic parser) and neural models (an LSTM) to detect grammatical acceptability. 
We implemented a simple symbolic parser and an LSTM model trained on the Penn Treebank. 
We then compared their accuracy in detecting grammatical acceptability using the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset.

### Hate speech detection 
<sub>*November 2019 - December 2020*<sub/> 
  
I collaborated on a group project to make a hate speech detector. We built an LSTM model trained on a dataset of comments from an online hate community forum to detect instances of hate speech (Pytorch).
