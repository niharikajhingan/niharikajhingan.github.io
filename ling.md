### Computational Models of Implicatures 
<sub>*May 2020 - Present* <sub /> 
  
Working with Daniel Smits, and professors Ellie Pavlick and Roman Feiman, I am exploring pragmatic reasoning and implicatures, and the generation of alternatives in computing an implicature. We are focusing on: 
- How these alternatives are cognitively structured and used
- How these alternatives can be computationally modelled and generated 

Co-presented at the Brown Unconference, and submitted a poster to the Brown Summer Research Symposium.

### Grammatical Gender Assignment in Code-Switching 
<sub>*August 2020 - Present*<sub/> 
  
I am working on an independent project, advised by professor Masako Fidler, on how grammatical gender is assigned in code-switched speech with a gendered embedded language. This project involves the exploration of the morphonological features of intraword code-switching. <br/>
I have designed a research study to explore this phenomenon in Russian-English, Czech-English, and Russian-Czech code-switching.
I am also analysing corpora for code-switched speech, like in the Czech National Corpus and the Russian National Corpus.

### Comparative Analysis of Neural and Symbolic Models for Grammatical Acceptability 
<sub>*March 2020 - May 2020* <sub/> 
  
With a group, I worked on a comparative analysis of the ability of symbolic and neural models to detect grammatical acceptability. We implemented a simple symbolic parser and an LSTM model trained on the Penn Treebank. We then compared their accuracy in detecting grammatical acceptability using the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset.

### Hate speech detection 
<sub>*November 2019 - December 2020*<sub/> 
  
I collaborated on a group project to make a hate speech detector. We built an LSTM model trained on a dataset of comments from an online hate community forum to detect instances of hate speech.
