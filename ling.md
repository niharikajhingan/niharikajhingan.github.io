### Comparative Analysis of Neural and Symbolic Models for Grammatical Acceptability 
<sub>*March 2020 - May 2020* <sub/> 
  
I worked with a group on a competitive analysis of the ability of symbolic models (a symbolic parser) and neural models (an LSTM) to detect grammatical acceptability. 
We implemented a simple symbolic parser and an LSTM model trained on the Penn Treebank. 
We then compared their accuracy in detecting grammatical acceptability using the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) dataset.

### Hate speech detection 
<sub>*November 2019 - December 2020*<sub/> 
  
I collaborated on a group project to make a hate speech detector. We built an LSTM model trained on a dataset of comments from an online hate community forum to detect instances of hate speech (Pytorch).
