### SleepCoacher 
<sub>*January 2019 - May 2020*<sub/> 
  
I worked on SleepCoacher, a mobile app that enables users to choose experiments, tracks user sleep data daily, and makes recommendations based on the data collected. The SleepCoacher mobile application can be found on the App Store.
Worked on the design and development of the iOS  app. I used Swift and Firebase for the app implementation. 
Helped launch the first non-beta version of the iOS application, along with multiple subsequent updated versions.
Collaborated on a study with veterans to investigate how they can use the application to improve sleep habits.
Conducted user interviews with veterans using the application to find helpful features and areas for improvements, and worked on thematic analysis of interview transcripts and diary logs, and data analysis of metric data.
